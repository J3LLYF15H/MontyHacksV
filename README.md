# Password Hacker

# A simple game meant to teach people about password security.

# Players will go through a series of levels specifically designed to teach people about a specific aspect of password security (e.g. easily guessable passwords, revealing password information, etc.). Our goal is to raise the sustainability of internet privacy to make people feel safer and more secure online.
