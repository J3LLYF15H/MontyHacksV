# Password Hacker

## What it does

Players will go through a series of levels specifically designed to teach people about a specific aspect of password security (e.g. easily guessable passwords, revealing password information, etc.). Our goal is to raise the sustainability of internet privacy to make people feel safer and more secure online.

## How we built it

We built this project in Repl.it, using Python Flask. This was the most familiar platform to work on for both of us, and after a bit of trial-and-error, we managed to create a working website. 

## Challenges we ran into

For both of us, this is our first hackathon, so we had some trouble starting the project. We wanted to follow the theme of sustainability, but in the end, we could not find a good idea, so we decided to continue with the best idea we had at the time.

While coding, we realized that both of us were unfamiliar with HTML and CSS, so we decided to keep the formatting of our site simple. We tried our best to make the site as visually appealing as we could make it, but due to lack of experience, it might not be as great as we would like it to be.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about HTML and CSS while creating this project, and refreshed our Python skills. Figuring out where to create our website was troublesome at first, but in the end, we found Flask and Repl.

## What's next for Password Hacker

Next, we would like to add more levels to our game, as well as make the website more visually appealing. It would be wonderful if Password Hacker could be expanded to include other aspects of cybersecurity, but that is a long way off.
